This is an AI camera project based on the Yolo model, designed to provide functionalities such as person recognition, electronic fencing, and person tracking. Below are the key features and usage instructions for the project.

## Key Features
- __Person Recognition:__ Utilizes the Yolo model for efficient and accurate person recognition.

- __Electronic Fencing:__ Detects whether a person is within a specified alert zone, changes the bounding box color, issues a warning, and stores information in a database.

- __Person Tracking:__ Implements person tracking functionality, predicting bounding boxes even when tracking is lost.

## Development Updates
- Basic person recognition in inference.py.
- Drawing inference result bounding boxes.
